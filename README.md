## Solve Problems Pattern wise and Revise Thoroughly

- Consistency is the key, Magic always lies on those things which you are avoiding.
- Pick Weak Topics First (as Per your choice) (in my case Disjoint sets , Graph Algorithms).
- Try to solve 2-3 questions daily pattern wise and make notes of some tricky questions.
- Revise after each topic completion.
